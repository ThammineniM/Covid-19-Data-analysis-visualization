# Covid-19-Data-analysis-visualization
In this project, we dive deep into COVID-19 data analysis and bring it to life through high-quality visualizations using Plotly Express in Python. 🚀🐍
We will create a wide range of insightful charts including:

📊 Bar Charts
📈 Line Graphs
🔵 Bubble Charts
⚫ Scatter Plots
All visualizations in this project are crafted with excellent clarity and quality, helping us understand the pandemic from a data-driven perspective.

🌍 Why Visualize COVID-19 Data?
Data visualization enables us to:

🔍 Understand complex trends
📉 Analyze outbreak patterns
📈 Predict future scenarios based on current data
🧠 Make informed decisions backed by analytics
Using Plotly Express, we bring patterns to the surface with powerful interactive visualizations that enhance understanding and exploration.
